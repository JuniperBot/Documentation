# Frequently Asked Questions

## Music is lagging and stuttering. How to fix that?

This issue can be cause by the following reasons:

* **Music servers under high load:** You can find current music servers load in the playback message or on the [Statistics](https://juniper.bot/status) page. If the load less than 80%, it is not an issue. 
* **Connection issues to Discord voice gateway or its high load:** There is a network unit between you and the bot called a voice gateway. Discord has a lot ot them tied to the Region selected in the voice channel settings. The issue may be between the gateway and the bot, or between you and this gateway. Try changing the region of the voice channel and see if the things got improved \(do not forget to completely restart the music playback\). 
* **–°onnection issues to the music source:** Beyond our control could be a connection issues to the music source \(YouTube, Yandex.Music, radio stations\) so the music source itself is under high load or the connection is unstable. The issues may be either temporary or permanent and this could happen for radio stations basicaly. Unfortunately, we are not a huge company and we cannot have a music servers in every part of the world to provide a stable connection to everything. If this happens, try changing the radio station, use YouTube instead of Yandex.Music, or vice versa.
