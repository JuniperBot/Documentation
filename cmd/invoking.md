{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

## Aliases

JuniperBot supports different languages for interface \(replies\) and commands. You can configure them at your server's dashboard in **Common** section.

This documentation will describe commands in English but also each command description will have table with command aliases for each supported language.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ð¡ommands language depends on server's region. For example, if region is Russia, then it would be russian by default.  
Language can be configured in server's dashboard in **Common** section.
