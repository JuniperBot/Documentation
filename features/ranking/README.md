# Member Ranking

### Enable Member Ranking <a id="enable"></a>

Member Ranking system is disabled by default, you can enable it in "Member Ranking" section of your [server's dashboard](../../#configure).

Also, you can configure it for your own needs: specify ignored roles and channels, level up announcement message, add level rewards, reset ranking for certain members or for the whole server.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use [Ranking Exp](experience.md) article to understand how EXP is calculated.
{% endhint %}

### Cookie Box <a id="cookies"></a>

Member Ranking system also includes a karma or reputation system called "Cookie Box". It is a simple counter you can increment in the following ways:

* Send a message with an member's mention and cookie emoji, for example: `@Member üç™`
* Add an cookie reaction to member's existent message.

{% hint style="info" %}
Cookie Box increment is rate-limited between members to not let them abuse it so they can give a cookie only once in 10 minutes.
{% endhint %}
