## Intro <a id="intro"></a>

If you managed to open this article, then you are brave enough ready to familiarize yourself with the power of the template engine. Probably.

This section will require a basic programming skills:

* Knowledge of simple data types and data structures;
* Ability to build a logical chains and compile them into algorithms;
* Ability and willingness to read and understand technical documentation.

If you're not into those things at all but just want to know how to insert variables and what variables exist, you have the last chance to return to the [Beginners](../beginners/) section.

Despite the fact that this guide is for the advanced users, it is still written as simple as possible for such things. Please be patient and read the entire section carefully before trying to do something.

If everything still seems too complicated and you do not understand what is happening here at all, try to do something based on the [Examples](../examples.md). Don't be afraid to experiment.

## Okay, I'm ready! What's next? <a id="ready"></a>

Nice! Proceed through each section of this guide one by one. [Syntax](syntax/) is your start point.
